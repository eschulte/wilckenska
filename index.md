## Dr. Wilckens

Dr. Wilckens investigates the role of sleep in promoting brain health
and cognitive fitness. Her research program focuses on 1) neural
processes during sleep that restore cognitive function and mitigate
neurodegeneration and 2) sleep enhancement interventions that improve
functioning of brain networks and mitigate cognitive impairments and
progression of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Sleep enhancement methods include
behavioral interventions and laboratory-based techniques such as
transcranial magnetic stimulation.
