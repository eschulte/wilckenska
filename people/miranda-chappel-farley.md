Dr. Miranda Chappel-Farley (she/her) is a postdoctoral scholar on the
Translational Research Training in Sleep and Circadian Science
T32. Her research focuses on uncovering underlying mechanisms by which
health behaviors (i.e., sleep and physical activity) impact brain and
cognitive function in older adulthood. The goal of this work is to
inform and develop more targeted mechanistic interventions to prevent
cognitive decline and Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
